current activities
==================

done: added list of information taps to ascendos.org/wiki/Development,
  which are much better general sources of information than this file.


first announced alpha
---------------------
first 6.1 alpha seems likely to be ready in the coming week, give or
take.  stage still needs to understand pluggable mirror layout options
rather than hardcoding the silly confused dev layout currently in use.
(but it hasn't been that hard to work around in automation, so I'm 
still aiming for an intermediary milestone of being able to reproduce
it as is from automation and koji input, and at that point, which 
seems near enough, I'll move on to the several alternate layout 
options (to the automation/stage-script)


upcoming beta tasks
-------------------
need to handle the existing package off-spec release naming issues, and the 
~200? 6.1 updates packages that need being built.


build3
------
goal: recreating build.ascendos.org contents in a more automated way
i.e. koji and its output.

(prior build2 run went to ~1950)
current status: ~300/~2800
current state: suspended while focusing on 6.1-alpha-rc3, and also new
anonymous testing person w/hardware resource (3 beefy systems) Andrew
introduced me to.  Formalized test/help procedures will be drafted, though
the first phase would boil down to familiarizing yourself with the
existing documentation, and figuring out how to blow that 100G bandwidth
from your ISP.  As that is a one time up front thing that will likely 
take a couple or more days anyway.

todo: need to add pxe live image serving configuration such that
any willing builder nodes on the local net are utilized


maintenance process
-------------------
need to start documenting candidate mainenance workflows, preferably with dia

- note, ran across old post from Troy about his rpmcomparing to SL6, somewhat
  contradicting how I responded to someone about what rpmcompare was used against
  by us.  Though I presume Troy's longterm intent was to rpmcompare against tuv, or
  at the least centos and similar, and not focus on the results against SL6.  
  BUT, the point is that such a phase against at least SL6 seems worth doing and
  encoding at the very least as a non?default option for the el-build user. 


build.a.o/linux/ascendos
------------------------
getting pretty close to being completely reproducible with a single
script invocation.  And updates are slowly beginning to churn through
the pipeline, so leaving the documentation of that to the koji logs.


misc todo
---------
- need to go through and clean quiet/verbose/debug functionality,
  perhaps even an eval wrapper, such that complex, and even simple
  commands like view-last-bake-vm have less chaotic terminal output
  (except when requested)
- need to revisit initial import process, as there has been a lot of
  code churn that has no doubt broken those scripts.  Use diffing sl
  and centos as dev/test cases if possible
